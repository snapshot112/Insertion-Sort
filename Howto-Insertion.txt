Sorting program requirements:
- reads zero or more numbers from STDIN
- reads fully buffered
- Prints same numbers in STDOUT
  > Prints 1 number per line
  > Prints in sorted order
- Must use linked lists (doubly or singly)
- Must use a version of insertion sort.
- Must end output with a newline.
  
Number specifics:
- Non-negative
- Separated by *ANY* whitespace, including newlines
- Only integers

Required flags:
> Accessible using getopt.
> Flags are processed in the order they are listed below.
0. Sort
1. -d Start printing at high instead of low.
2. -c Add every successive 2 items together when printing (no successor = just print that number solo)
3. -o removes all odd numbers from the sorted list
4. -z split and zip sorted list
   > Sort first, split sorted list in 2 halves (uneven means the lower numbers go in the bigger half)
   > Then zip items together, first the lowest number in the half with the lower numbers, then the lowest number in the half with the bigger numbers.

> Check for descending order conflicts and specify its behavior with other flags.
> -o and -z might have conflicting behavior: First remove then add? or the other way around...
